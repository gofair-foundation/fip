# Revising your FIP

Changes in the FIP are automatically saved.

There is no undo button for any action BUT you can use the version history button (25) which allows you to:

- see all changes done by any editors

- see details on each activity when clicking on it

- by clicking on the three dots you see a menu with an option to revert to this version

If you want to answer a specific question later, click on the **plus button** to get a **TODO reminder** (26).

Clicking the TODO button you will see all the TODOs as list.

For each question, you can add a comment and replies to that comment which should assist interactions within your team.

After having submitted a document as a nanopublication you might still want to correct your declarations in the FIP and publish a new version. The new nanopublication is recognized as an update of the older submission. This is true also for FER nanopublications which makes it possible to show only the latest version of a specific FER in the drop-down menus for the answers.

A nanopublication is just that - a publication. As such, it is persistent and can not be deleted from the nanopub record. However, as with any traditional publication, nanopublications can be “retracted”. This is done by issuing a special purpose retraction nanopublication, linking to the original. This can only be done by the FIP facilitator. If you feel a nanopublication minted in the FIP Wizard should be retracted, please add a new issue in our [qualification github repository](https://github.com/gofair-foundation/fsr_qualification/issues).
