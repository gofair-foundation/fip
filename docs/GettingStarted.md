 - Select the tab: From Project Template 
 - Enter a name for your FIP: We recommend [Community acronym]_FIP
 - Select a template from the drop-down list
 - You’ll see here 5 templates - select “FAIR Implementation Profile”  
 - Later, when minting nanopublications, you’ll use the other templates:
   - A FAIR Implementation Community (FIC)
   - A FAIR Enabling Resource from FAIRsharing
   - A FAIR Enabling Resource (FER)
   - A Metadata Preservation Policy (MPP)
 - Click Save. This will bring you to the FIP questionnaire. You can now start to work with the FIP Wizard questionnaire, and make FIP declarations (see below).
 - Principally there should be one and only one person that acts as a data steward for the community and enters all answers. However, in most cases the answers will need to be agreed upon within an expert team of that community. By clicking on the Share button on the top right you can provide editing or viewing rights for your colleagues (9).
